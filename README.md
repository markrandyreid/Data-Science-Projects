# Data Science & Data Analytics Projects
Thanks for visiting!

This is a porfolio of Data Science and Data Analytics projects from academia and industry using the following languages:
* Matlab
* Python
* R
* SQLite

<p>Projects and assigments range in level of difficulty and analysis. 
  The goal of displaying this work is to provide a comprehensive view of my ability and experience in Data Science and Data Analytics, in general. 
  Every project/assignment includes a brief description of the task/question, the method used, and the [desired] outcome [if applicable].</p>

  As this portfolio develops, I'll organize the files by subject, language, etc.

<strong>Please Note:</strong> university assignments are <strong>NOT</strong> are not organized by course or school to preserve privacy and academic integrity

# Why R? 
<p>Python is the prevailing language used for data science and data analytics. It's fairly easy to learn, has extensive libraries and a large community of developers and scientist that update the language and libraries. The R programming language is still used amoung fortune 100 companies and many academic/research institutions. R was the first language I learned and it just stuck with me</p>
